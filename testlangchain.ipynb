We will split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\n",

    "#### **Query Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we are executing the retrieval using the raw input query. However, there are some advantages to allowing a model to generate the query for retrieval purposes. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In addition to semantic search, we can build in structured filters (e.g., \"Find documents since the year 2020.\");\n",
    "* The model can rewrite user queries, which may be multifaceted or include irrelevant language, into more effective search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query analysis employs models to transform or construct optimized search queries from raw user input. We can easily incorporate a query analysis step into our application. For illustrative purposes, let's add some metadata to the documents in our vector store. We will add some (contrived) sections to the document which we can filter on later."
